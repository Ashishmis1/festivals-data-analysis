### 💡 About This Project
**Why I built this:**

Started this project to understand how people shop during festivals. Worked with real sales data (~11K records) and honestly, it was messier than I expected. Spent a lot of time cleaning missing values and fixing data types, but that's where I learned the most.

The goal was simple - find out who's buying what, and see if there are any patterns that could help businesses make better decisions.

Currently looking for data analyst roles. If you have any feedback on this project or want to connect, feel free to reach out.

## 💭 What I Learned

- **Data is always messy**: The dataset had 12 missing values in the Amount column and inconsistent data types. Had to drop those rows and convert types manually.
- **Groupby is powerful**: Used it extensively to slice data by demographics. Really helped understand patterns across different customer segments.
- **Visualization matters**: Tried different chart types - bar plots worked best for this categorical data. The graphs made it way easier to spot trends.
- **Context is everything**: Raw numbers don't mean much without understanding the business context. Had to think about what insights would actually be useful for a business.
